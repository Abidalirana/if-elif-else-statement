# if-elif-else-statement
if, elif, and else are used for decision making in Python to run different blocks of code based on conditions—if checks the first condition, elif checks more conditions if the first is false, and else runs if none of the conditions are true.¶
* if
check if correct condition then execute the code.
* elif
The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
else
* else
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
